            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was a high school math teacher of 10 years, and have always loved to read and travel to the mountains in my spare time. I also enjoy riddles and puzzles, and canâ€™t say no to a good escape room.</p>

<p>I wrote this novel last summer for my fourteen-year-old self because as a teenager I was battling depression and suicidal thoughts due to neglect, and wanted an outlet to heal. I became a teacher mostly because I wanted to be like the handful of impactful mentors that I had growing up, who truly saw me. I wrote them into my story to share with you. I now live with my two beautiful children, and I have been married to my rock, my partner-in-crime, for twelve years. I live in North Carolina.</p>
