            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I was a high school math teacher of 10 years, and have always loved to read and travel to the mountains in my spare time. I also enjoy riddles and puzzles, and can't say no to a good escape room.</p>
      <p>I wrote this novel last summer for my fourteen-year-old self because as a teenager I battled depression and suicidal thoughts, and wanted an outlet to heal. I became a teacher mostly because I wanted to be like the handful of impactful mentors that I had growing up, who truly saw me. I wrote them into my story to share with you.</p>
       <p>I now live with my two beautiful children, and my husband of twelve years. I live in North Carolina.</p>
